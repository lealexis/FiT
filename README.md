# FiT(Fidelity Threshold) protocol
Simulation and implementation of the FiT Link layer quantum communication 
protocol. A noisy communication link between Alice and Bob is established 
to enable the distribution of quantum frames from Alice to Bob. The quantum 
frame's payload is either entanglement a.k.a. EPR(Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen)-Pairs 
or superdense encoded information i.e. _EPR-frame_ or _SDC-frame_. The classical
information that is superdense encoded at Alice and sent to Bob is shown
bellow and referenced as _mario_.<br/>

Since the generated EPR-Pairs are imperfect, i.e. they are generated by 
the [EPR-pair generator](/epr_gen_class.py) with a fidelity bellow the 
maximum fidelity of _1_. Additionaly, the half of the EPR-pair that belongs
to Bob is sent to him over a noisy quantum channel implemented as an 
[angle &#947; passed to a R-xy gate](/rotational_error_class.py) and 
applied to the EPR-pair-half in distribution. Consequently, The fidelity
of a distributed EPR-pair decreases, depending on its pre-distribution
fidelity and the &#947; angle applied at the R-xy gate; This effect is 
shown in the image bellow.<br/>

When an _EPR-frame_ is distributed, its fidelity is estimated by measuring
some EPR-pairs from the payload[^1]. This is achieved thanks to the 
[epr-frame length estimator](/pred_q.py) and [entanglement manager](/qmem_manager.py).<br/>

Finally, in order to prevent errors when sending superdense encoded 
information from Alice to Bob, a fidelity threshold policy is endorsed.
Any distributed _EPR-frame_ whose estimated fidelity is lower than the
decided threshold fidelity between Alice and Bob are discarded.
