# FiT(Fidelity Threshold) protocol
Simulation and implementation of the FiT Link layer quantum communication 
protocol. A noisy communication link between Alice and Bob is established 
to enable the distribution of quantum frames from Alice to Bob. The quantum 
frame's payload is either entanglement a.k.a. EPR(Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen)-Pairs 
or superdense encoded information i.e. EPR-frame or SDC-frame. The classical
information that is superdense encoded at Alice and sent to Bob is shown
bellow and referenced as _mario_.

Since the generated EPR-Pairs are imperfect, i.e. they are generated by 
the [EPR-pair generator](/epr_gen_class.py) with a fidelity bellow the 
maximum fidelity of 1. Additionaly, the half of the EPR-pair that belongs
to Bob is sent to him over a noisy quantum channel implemented as an 
[angle $\gamma$ passed to a R-xy gate](/rotational_error_class.py) and 
applied to the EPR-pair-half in distribution. Consequently, The fidelity
of a distributed EPR-pair decreases, depending on its pre-distribution
fidelity and the $/gamma$ angle applied at the R-xy gate. This is shown 
in the image bellow.

The distributed entanglement satisfies a 
minimal threshold fidelity.
